Maharashtra Day, also known as Maharashtra Din, is a time to celebrate the rich history and culture of the Indian state of Maharashtra. This special day honors the state's formation on May 1st, 1960 from the division of Bombay State.

A quick look into Maharashtra Diwas' history takes us back to the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. This Act sought to define Indian states based on languages spoken. However, Bombay was a melting pot of different languages like Marathi, Gujarati, Kutchi, and Konkani. As a result, movements like Sanyukta Maharashtra Samiti and Mahagujarat Movement were born to create separate states for these language groups. After much turmoil and the introduction of the Bombay Reorganization Act, Maharashtra and Gujarat were finally formed.

Now, every year on May 1st, the Government of Maharashtra commemorates this historic moment with a public holiday. Various activities take place across the state such as parades at Shivaji Park in Dadar attended by the Governor and other dignitaries. The celebrations also include cultural events displaying local traditions like Lavani dance performances and narrations of Marathi saint poetry.
